# Bike Sharing Data Analysis
Data Science Institute - Cohort 5 - Team Project
# Overview
As part of our Final Team Project for the Data Science Software Foundations certificate, we have selected the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset) from the given datasets. This dataset provides historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions, and temporal information, making it ideal for exploring trends, patterns, and predictive modeling.
# Business Case
Our target audience are bike sharing companies looking to expand into other cities with a similar population size and seasonal trends as Washington D.C. Referring to the bike sharing usage patterns in Washington D.C. will help make an informed decision about bike demand in other cities. Our goal is to build a predictive model to forecast bike demand based on factors such as weather, seasons, holidays etc.

# Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
There do not seem to be any missing values, and the data do not seem to require extensive cleaning. Our team will be conducting a more thorough exploration of the data within the next day or so and update this section.
